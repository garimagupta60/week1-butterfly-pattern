This branch contains the code for Week 1 - Assignment 1, which generates a butterfly pattern based on user input.

I take the user input of rows and applied input validation on that.
Created a user defined function named stringToInteger for implementing the functionality of atoi function.
isDigit() → Checks if a character is a digit.

stringToInteger() → Converts valid input string to an integer.

getRowsFromUser() → Gets validated input from the user.

printPattern() → Generates and prints the butterfly pattern.

Generates a butterfly pattern with alternating/toggling 1s and 0s
